Assistant related code lives here. Each subpackage focuses on a different presentation layer so we can add chat bots or other helpers without bloating the core game packages.

- `cli/` – the terminal-based Duck Assistant that wraps code statistics, AI chat, and the red packet mini game

Future additions (e.g., voice or web channels) can drop in as new subpackages next to `cli`.
